### Current Status
- Game simulations have been decoupled from rendering and can be simulated very quickly
- 1024 AI agents are created with random neural networks then played against each other
- Playing full games (60 seconds or first to 3)
- Agents with the most points (top 20%) are allowed to reproduce
- I tried both sexual and asexual reproduction
	- Two parents - Randomly chose weights and biases from each parent
	- One parent - Copied then mutated
- Ran for ~10,000 generations with each agent playing 8 games per generation
### Results
- Agents got pretty good at kickoffs, but not much else
- The best networks never organically grew beyond 2 levels
- I didn't see a tangible difference between asexual and sexual reproduction
	- I didn't have a good way to track progress, so it's possible their learning curves were different but by generation 10,000 things leveled out
	- It's more likely that the were both limited in their intelligence by the 2-level limit
### Hypotheses
- There's something discouraging networks that mutate to add a level
	- Identity levels can be added without side effects, but when they are mutated and change back to a normal activation function, the entire network could be invalidated ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- The simulation is too complex and there's not enough coverage to generate good all-purpose AI
- Sexual reproduction seems like a good idea, but it needs more structure than randomly picking neurons and weights
### Takeaways and Potential Next Steps
- Test with deeper networks
	- Fix whatever is so strongly discouraging deeper networks
	- Try starting with 3 levels
- Train with more initial starting positions than the single kickoff
- Simplify the simulation
	- Initially train on simplified elements (ie. just shooting or blocking) and combine them later
	- Remove unnecessary inputs to run more iterations
	  üìùThis would only save 3 inputs (my score, their score, and time remaining)
- Group neurons into genes then randomly select those from each parent rather than individual neurons
	- Try sexual reproduction with more than two parents
- Reimplement in Cuda to increase number of simulations that can be run in parallel
### Video Status
Top AI from generation 9,000 vs middle of the road AI at same generation
- Each has a  two level neural network

Top two AI from generation 9,000 playing against each other
- They are both aggressive on the kickoff, but don't react well after

### Current Status
- The simulation, neural network, and glue between them is working well enough that two randomly seeded neural network driven AI players can play a game against each other.
- The AI's networks have 2 levels, 21 inputs, and 3 outputs. Using TanH activation function because most of the outputs want to be centered around 0 (eg. speed and steering)
- Inputs - position, velocity, facing, and boost % for each player, score and time remaining
- Outputs - Steering, speed, boost

This is one of the more interesting games

Most of the games were less exciting and went more like this...
